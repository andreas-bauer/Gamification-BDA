    "text": "Software testing is an integral part of software development. Developers incorporate tests from low-level unit tests to high-level system tests and GUI-based tests. GUI-based tests can verify a system’s behavior through interactions with its GUI the same way a user would. One approach to increase the engagement and motivation of people performing a task is Gamification, where elements originated in games are applied in a non-gaming context. In the context of exploratory GUI-based testing, Gamification could improve testers’ engagement and therefore improve the outcome of test activities.\nCoppola et al. [1] conducted an experiment with 144 participants to investigate how Gamification would impact the effectiveness and efficiency of exploratory GUI testing.\nIn this project, I perform a (re-)analysis of the impacts of Gamification for exploratory GUI testing using Bayesian Data Analysis (BDA). Input for this analysis is the replication package from the experiment [1]."

Here B and W stay independent\nPipe: In a pipe, variables influence the next element in the pipe, e.g., B -> COV -> EF. B influences COV, which influences EF. Conditioning on COV would block the information flow between B and EF.\nCollider: In this DAG, an example of a collider is the EJ -> W <- EW. A relationship between EF and WE only appears if you condition on W; otherwise, there will be no association between EJ and WE.\nDescendent: The DAG consists of multiple descendent relationships, e.g., AW -> COV <- B; COV -> EF. A descendent (EF) is influenced by another variable (COV).\n\n\n[[1]]\ndag {\nAW\nB\nCOV\nEF\nEJ\nET\nEW\nG\nW\nAW -> COV\nB -> COV\nCOV -> EF\nEJ -> B\nEJ -> W\nET -> B\nET -> W\nEW -> B\nEW -> W\nG -> B\nG -> W\nW -> COV\n}\n\n\nAW _||_ B\nAW _||_ EF | COV\nAW _||_ EJ\nAW _||_ ET\nAW _||_ EW\nAW _||_ G\nAW _||_ W\nB _||_ EF | COV\nB _||_ W | EJ, ET, EW, G\nCOV _||_ EJ | B, W\nCOV _||_ ET | B, W\nCOV _||_ EW | B, W\nCOV _||_ G | B, W\nEF _||_ EJ | B, W\nEF _||_ EJ | COV\nEF _||_ ET | B, W\nEF _||_ ET | COV\nEF _||_ EW | B, W\nEF _||_ EW | COV\nEF _||_ G | B, W\nEF _||_ G | COV\nEF _||_ W | COV\nEJ _||_ ET\nEJ _||_ EW\nEJ _||_ G\nET _||_ EW\nET _||_ G\nEW _||_ G"
